must have:
    - managing tasks 
    - make the intervals constant but have 1-4 images posted   
    - storage solution for settings 
    - change the genre of images gathered i.e. 
    - find a list of artists then grab images from these artists on the boorus 
can have: 
    - define multiple tasks per user with different intervals
    - maybe set limits on tasks
    - role checks
    - add more interactivity to commands like bot waiting for user input instead of doing simple commands
