must have:
    - managing tasks 
    - make the intervals constant but have 1-4 images posted
        e.g. !fufu 2
    - storage solution for settings 
    - change the genre of images gathered i.e. 
can have: 
    - define multiple tasks per user with different intervals
    - maybe set limits on tasks
    - role checks
    - add more interactivity to commands like bot waiting for user input instead of doing simple commands
